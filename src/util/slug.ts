/**
 * The one slug rule in this repo.
 *
 * Every slug site used to carry its own inline copy of `[^a-z0-9\s-]`. That is a rule
 * about the **Latin alphabet**, not a rule about what a filesystem or a URL can hold,
 * and Thai is the primary working language here. The consequences were two, and the
 * quiet one is the worse one:
 *
 *   'ทดสอบไทยล้วนไม่มีอังกฤษ' -> ''          the file became `<date>_.md`
 *   'ทดสอบ fallback ไทยล้วน'  -> 'fallback'  one stray Latin token survived
 *
 * The first is loud: a collision guard (#2819) now appends `-2`, `-3`, … so it no longer
 * throws, but every such learning still shares one meaningless filename. The second
 * looks like success — the file has a plausible name and the title is simply gone.
 *
 * The rule below is about **character class**, not about script: keep letters (\p{L}),
 * numbers (\p{N}) and combining marks (\p{M}) from any script, drop everything else.
 *
 * \p{M} is not optional. Thai tone marks and above/below vowels are nonspacing marks,
 * not letters, so \p{L}\p{N} alone mangles the word rather than preserving it:
 *
 *   'ทดสอบไทยล้วน' with \p{M}    -> 'ทดสอบไทยล้วน'
 *   'ทดสอบไทยล้วน' without \p{M} -> 'ทดสอบไทยลวน'   (the ้ on ล is dropped)
 *
 * ASCII is unaffected, by construction: no ASCII character is in \p{L}\p{N}\p{M} that
 * was not already in `[a-z0-9]` once the input is lower-cased, and none that was
 * excluded becomes included ('_' is \p{Pc}, not \p{M}). `tests/util/slug-ascii-identity.test.ts`
 * proves that exhaustively against the old expressions rather than asserting it here.
 *
 * Salvaged from the idea in PR #2934 (@yimtheppariyapol), re-implemented as one shared
 * rule instead of a fourth private copy of it.

/**
 * Slugs land in filenames, and filesystems budget in **bytes**. ext4 and APFS both cap a
 * name at 255 bytes; Thai costs 3 bytes per character in UTF-8, so the 80-character input
 * window `safeHandoffSlug` uses would have produced a 240-byte slug and a 260-byte
 * `<date>_<time>_<slug>.md` — ENAMETOOLONG, a new failure mode introduced by the fix.
 *
 * 120 bytes is above every call site's character window (50 and 80), so an all-ASCII slug
 * can never reach it and nothing about today's ASCII output changes.
